        <p>Hi! My name is Brian Joo and I am currently a student at Rithm School's software engineering bootcamp. Before
          that though, I was almost a decade into porcelain sink manufacturing work. And before that, I was in the Army
          fixing up helicopters.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You could say that I love jobs that require great physicality to them, but after I wrote my first line of
          code,
          I was just hooked. It seems like the field of software engineering is constantly evolving with new challenges
          arising all the time. And that was very enticing for me. So, I took the plunge and am now dedicating the next
          couple months to really learn what it takes to become a great software engineer.</p>
